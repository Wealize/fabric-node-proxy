# Fabric Node Proxy

The framework we're using the most for Blockchain implementations is [Hyperledger Fabric](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.3/).

The documentation in their site is not bad, but it's not very thorough,
it's important to get concepts clear on the [Buiding your First Network](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.3/build_network.html)
and [Writing your first application](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.3/write_first_app.html) tutorials.

## Components

In TNP we use several components to simplify how we develop smart contracts and its deployment and configuration.

## IBM Blockchain

IBM Blockchain is our `server`, it deploys easily a Hyperledger Fabric server we can use to deploy our smart contracts. You can see how to configure IBM Blockchain on their excellent [video tutorials](https://developer.ibm.com/series/ibm-blockchain-platform-console-video-series/).

We use Typescript as the language for the smart contracts and the proxy.

## Proxy

Fabric client SDKs are under heavy development and currently the Node SDK is the most mature. We might use the Python SDK in the future but It doesn't work well right now.

Since we have many backend code written in Python and we need to connect and execute smart contract functions from there, we decided to create a proxy in Node with Typescript for Fabric so we have a Rest API to access from any other backend,
so we don't need to take into account in which language we write our backend, but just create an API HTTP client to execute functions on an specific smart contract.

## Project implementation

We'll need to create a request to the Fabric proxy every time we want to send data to the smart contract.

## How to implement in a project

There are three steps to implement a solution with Hyperledger Fabric.

## Create the organizations and the channel where the smart contract is gonna execute

Only organizations in the channel will be able to use the smart contract deployed there. Assets data saved in this channel isn't
available in other channels.

## Create the smart contract (chaincode for Hyperledger Fabric)

To give our project Blockchain powers we'll need to implement one (or maybe more) smart contracts.

[You have an example in the Odos repository](https://github.com/TheNeonProject/odos/tree/master/chaincode).

You should follow the same structure so you can also implement the tests and run everything using Docker. The idea would be to do something like:

Create the `chaincode` dir in your project. Inside this folder, we'll create the `Dockerfile` and a dir called `ngo`. ngo dir will have smart contract code (`ngo.ts`) and its tests (`ngo.spec.ts`) among other libraries of our own to simplify the code.

```bash
mkdir chaincode
cd chaincode
touch ngo.ts
touch ngo.spec.ts
```

Copy the Dockerfile content from [Odos repository example](https://github.com/TheNeonProject/odos/blob/master/chaincode/Dockerfile) in your Dockerfile

Now, build the docker image:

```bash
docker build -t project-chaincode .
```

To run the tests:

```bash
docker run --rm -v "$PWD":/usr/src/app -w /usr/src/app/project project-chaincode
```

## HTTP client in the project

Every project connecting to the Fabric proxy will need a service implementing the GET to read and POST to write to the Fabric proxy with its specific smart contract
and methods. [An example can be seen in the Odos project](https://github.com/TheNeonProject/odos/blob/master/refugees/services.py#L13)

The `GET` would be:

```curl
GET {host}/api/v1/{chaincode_name}/{chaincode_method}?token={token}
Content-type: application/json
```

The `POST` looks like this:

```curl
POST {host}/api/v1/{chaincode_name}/{chaincode_method}?token={token}
Content-type: application/json

body
```

The response in both cases would be:

```json
Content-type: application/json

{
  "status": "ok",
  "data": [{"my": "data"}]
}

```

In case of error:

```json
Content-type: application/json

{
  "status": "error",
  "message": "message"
}

```

## CI/CD

Please check the `.github` folder to see how we develop using Github Actions on
this project.

To complete the Github Actions configuration you need the following variables:

- `$CODACY_PROJECT_TOKEN`
- `$HEROKU_API_TOKEN`
- `$HEROKU_APP_STAGING`
- `$HEROKU_APP_PRODUCTION`
- `$SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL`

## Config to generate certificates

This part of the configuration is a bit cumbersome, so take a coffe and read carefully, we'll dive into it step by step ðŸ˜Ž

If you haven't do it yet, clone the [fabric proxy repository](https://github.com/TheNeonProject/fabric-node-proxy) in your local machine and `cd` in it, we'll just work on it now.

The config to generate the certificates has to be downloaded from IBM Blockchain, and added to the root
of the repository as `creds.json`.

Add this json to the proxy configuration in Heroku using the `FABRIC_CREDS` envvar.

## Config to query from Fabric node proxy

Now we'll work in the config to perform queries to the chaincode/smart contract.

- Start with `yarn install` to install all dependencies.
- Build typescript with `yarn build`.
- Execute `enrollUser` with the following command.

```bash
  CONNECTION_JSON_PATH=../connection.json \
  ADMIN_USERNAME=admin \
  USER_USERNAME=user1 node enrollUser.js
```

*CONNECTION_PATH* is a file we can get when we instantiate for the first time a smart contract on IBM Blockchain platform, so if this happened you can check if it's on 1password under the project vault.
*ADMIN_USERNAME* is the admin wallet in charge of this channel, this we also need to get from IBM Blockchain.
*USER_USERNAME* is the user we want to enroll for this app locally, his/her credentials will be stored in the `wallet` local folder.

- If `enrollUser` is executed without problems, lets create the json that will contain all users info and its certificates. Create a new json, for example `certs.json` This will consist in a composition of the generated users and certificates for the client. Go to `wallet` directory and merge merge all those files into a json. The json will consist in:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "admin",
    "mspid": "Org1MSP",
    "roles": null,
    "affiliation": "",
    "enrollmentSecret": "",
    "enrollment": {
      "signingIdentity": "0cf19acace3478ba452ad21c3046e238a830b0690ac",
      "identity": {
        "certificate": "..."
      }
    },
    "keys": {
      "private": "Private key <signingIdentity-priv> file content",
      "public": "Public key <signingIdentity-pub> file content"
    }
  },
  {
    "name": "user1",
    "mspid": "Org1MSP",
    "roles": null,
    "affiliation": "",
    "enrollmentSecret": "",
    "enrollment": {
      "signingIdentity": "9b7fc81cd01bcb15d4ab61368c82f14fa0107ae71",
      "identity": {
        "certificate": "..."
      }
    },
    "keys": {
      "private": "Private key <signingIdentity-priv> file content",
      "public": "Public key <signingIdentity-pub> file content"
    }
  },
  {
    "name": "user2",
    "mspid": "org1",
    "roles": null,
    "affiliation": "",
    "enrollmentSecret": "",
    "enrollment": {
      "signingIdentity": "2e33bc2c84fb78ce987488d7773b22b79ae55e2453",
      "identity": {
        "certificate": ""
      }
    },
    "keys": {
      "private": "Private key <signingIdentity-priv> file content",
      "public": "Public key <signingIdentity-pub> file content"
    }
  }
]
```

- We can test the configuration locally using `invoke` and `query`

```bash
CONNECTION_JSON_PATH=../connection.json WALLET_PATH=wallet USER_USERNAME=user1 node invoke.js
CONNECTION_JSON_PATH=../connection.json WALLET_PATH=wallet USER_USERNAME=user1 node query.js
```

To run the server locally we need:

```bash
APP_TOKEN=token CONNECTION_JSON_PATH=../connection.json WALLET_PATH=wallet USER_USERNAME=user1 USER_USERNAME=user1 node server.js
```

Once the json is created, add it to Heroku project as `FABRIC_CERTS` envvar.

Let's Blockchain! Hiii Yaaa!
